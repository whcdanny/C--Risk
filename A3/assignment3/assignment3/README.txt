I design a new Adapter class that can be called in the same way, but reading 
/writing in a different format, such as .txt, .map.

The function and idea are same assignment 1 and 2.

In assignment 3, i just prove the a new dapter class, and change a little different method, i changed the MapParser, the Continent and Territory class. And I prove my code is working and no error.
